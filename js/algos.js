//release0 - write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns the longest word or phrase in the array

//define a function and pass it an array as an argument
//iterate through each index in the array (in the example we have strings)
//sort through each index, by swapping indexes based on string length
//move the largest string to one end of the array
//print that string by accessing the index value

var word_arr = ["abc", "a", "abcd", "abcde", "ab"];
